# Fizz-Buzz problem
Write a function that takes a positive integer as its only parameter. This function loops from 1 to that number and prints __fizz__ if the number is divisble by 3, __buzz__ if the number is divisible by 5 and __fizzbuzz__ if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 at the same time.
